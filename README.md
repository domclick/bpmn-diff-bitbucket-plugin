# BPMN Diff Bitbucket Plugin
This plugin allows to visually compare BPMN file versions during pull requests in Bitbucket Server. 

The plugin adds "BPMN Visual Diff" button to the Pull Request Diff page.

The button is visible only for BPMN files and leads to a separate page which allows to visually compare two BPMN file 
versions.

## Build Requirements
 - **Node** 12.13.0
 - **Maven** 3.6.2
 - **Java JDK** 1.8
 - [**Atlassian SDK 8**](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/downloads/)
 
## Usage Requirements
 - Bitbucket Server **7.0**
 - Client-side Extensions Runtime **1.2.3**

## Starting Bitbucket

To start Bitbucket, first install all the maven dependencies:

```sh
atlas-package -DskipTests
```

Next, run this command to start Bitbucket:

```sh
atlas-run -DskipTests
```

## Developing the plugin

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

It builds the frontend and puts it in the watch mode with hot reload.
In other words, if you have the whole plugin, and an instance already working,
this will enable you to make quick changes with an instant preview.
